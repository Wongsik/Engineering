            <b>8/25/23</b> - This week we continued to create our website, discussed about engineering, and participated in a group challenge
            <br>
            <br>
            - On Wednesday, we discussed a little on different types of engineering and what engineering is.
                <br>
                     &nbsp > We also talked about different ways of approaching a problem when engineering something, whether its research or looking at inspiration.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp  > Another thing we discussed was the difference between an invention and innovation. An invention is a new idea and creation that has never been done,
                    while an innovation is making something that has already been made, better.
                    <br>
                - On Thursday, the class attempted a group challenge.
                    <br>
                     &nbsp> We had to create and hold up a pathway for a marble to reach a destination. The only thing was that there were a limited amount of pipes we used to
                    create the pathway. Requiring the group to devise a plan that would successfully transport the marble to its destination.

                - This weekend I have many homework assignments I need to do, along with many classes I'd like to get ahead in. I also am going to watch the new movie
                Gran Turismo, on Sunday.
            <br>
            Overrall, this week was a great experience and start for starting this engineering class. I hope to have other experiences similar to what we did this week,
            and I am excited for the future projects, that are to come.

            <b>9/1/23</b> - This week we continued to learn engineering processes and started to CAD
            <br>
            <br>
            - One thing we did was going more in depth into different types of engineering, especially mechanical engineering.
             <br>
                     &nbsp > We also learned the process and safety of mechanical. We learned workplace etiquette and properness. Also, we learned the things that mechanical engineering consisted of; like mathematics, kinematics, and CAD.
                     <br>
                     &nbsp > Anoher thing we started, was a rube goldberg machine. As a group we planned a machine to pop a balloo, and also requested materials for the machine.
            <br>
            - The challenge we participated in this week, was a CAD competition.
            <br>
            &nbsp > Me personally, I desgined a PS5, which also happened to win the competition.
            <br>
            &nbsp > It also gave me more experience in CAD, so I can use it and apply my skills in future projects.

             <br>
            Overall, this week was a great continuation of this engineering elective. I hope to continue learning and growing as a engineer, as we go through more challenges and activities in this class.

            <b>9/8/23</b> This week we finished CADing out Rube Goldberg Machine
            <br>
            <br>
            - This week was mostly CADing, as we learned more about using Tinkercad.
            <br>
                     &nbsp > As we used Tinkercad, we learned new techniques that helped us make a prototype of out Rube Goldberg Machine.
                     <br>
                     &nbsp > Our Rube Goldberg Machine will conist of a ball that will hit a pulley, causing a toy car to start moving, which would hit a lever, popping a balloon.
                     <br>
                     &nbsp > I think the most challenging part will be using the carboard to perfectly replicate our prototype.
                     <br>

             <br>
             Overall, this week was very important, as we are now able to start working on our actual Rube Goldberg Machine.
