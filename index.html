            <b>8/20/23</b> - This week we continued to create our website, discussed about engineering, and participated in a group challenge
            <br>
            <br>
            - On Wednesday, we discussed a little on different types of engineering and what engineering is.
                <br>
                     &nbsp > We also talked about different ways of approaching a problem when engineering something, whether its research or looking at inspiration.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp  > Another thing we discussed was the difference between an invention and innovation. An invention is a new idea and creation that has never been done,
                    while an innovation is making something that has already been made, better.
                    <br>
                - On Thursday, the class attempted a group challenge.
                    <br>
                     &nbsp> We had to create and hold up a pathway for a marble to reach a destination. The only thing was that there were a limited amount of pipes we used to
                    create the pathway. Requiring the group to devise a plan that would successfully transport the marble to its destination.
                    <br>
                - This weekend I have many homework assignments I need to do, along with many classes I'd like to get ahead in. I also am going to watch the new movie
                Gran Turismo, on Sunday.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overrall, this week was a great experience and start for starting this engineering class. I hope to have other experiences similar to what we did this week,
            and I am excited for the future projects, that are to come.
