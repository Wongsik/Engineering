        <p>
            <b>1/19/24</b> - This week we started our Quater 3 project.
            <br>
            <br>
            - We chose to do make and code an Arduino car.
                <br>
                     &nbsp > Our idea is an obstacle course, inspired by the real life moose test.
                     <br>
                     &nbsp > We will need to utilize many types of engineering types and processes to successfully complete this project.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall, I am excited to see what we encounter as we progress through this project.
