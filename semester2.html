            <b>1/19/24</b> - This week we started our Quater 3 project.
            <br>
            <br>
            - We chose to do make and code an Arduino car.
                <br>
                     &nbsp > Our idea is an obstacle course, inspired by the real life moose test.
                     <br>
                     &nbsp > We will need to utilize many types of engineering types and processes to successfully complete this project.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall, I am excited to see what we encounter as we progress through this project.

            <b>1/26/24</b> - We continued on our Quarter 3 project. This week we worked on CADing our design.
            <br>
            <br>
            - This was an activity we had done 2 weeks ago, where we had messed with Non-Newtonian Fluid.

            <br>
            - For our project, we had completed the CAD on what it is going to look like, and started to research for the electronics.
            <br>
            &nbsp > Since we are unable to have wheels steer like a real car, we decided to use 6 wheels, where the 2 wheels in the middle will be powered by motors, and invert directions when we need to turn.
            <br>
            &nbsp > We also had the idea to have a closed top for the electronics so that we can fit all the parts with as little space we can.
            <br>
            &nbsp > We plan to have the top be able to fold so we can open it up and work with the electronics with little trouble.
            <br>

            <br>
            &nbsp > Next week we will continue to work on the electronics CAD and hopefully to get it to work, so we can started building the car with actual materials.
            <br>
            <br>
            I enjoyed this week as we started the proper engineering process as we started the CAD, ran into problems, and were able to work around the problems. I cannot wait to see what is to come for this project.
